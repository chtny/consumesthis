Consumes This is directly inspired by [Uses This](https://usesthis.com/) by Daniel Bogan. I love the interviews they post, asking people what they use for their work. At the same time, I am curious to know what kind of content people consume through social media, blogs, podcasts, videos, etc. And hence, I decided to start asking people around and posting their replies here on this website.

## Schedule?
At the start, I am trying to ask one person every week, but not sure about the exact day it gets published.

## Feeds?
RSS: [https://consumesthis.com/feed.xml](https://consumesthis.com/feed.xml)

## Suggestions?
Of people to ask from and in general, are hugely appreciated! Drop me an email at hello(at)chaitanya.page with the subject "Consumes This".

## Support?
This is still an experimental project and should not receive monetary support till it reaches somewhere. Please share it with people instead!

### Thank you for dropping by!
