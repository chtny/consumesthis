### Who are you?
I'm a lover of technology and enjoy exploring its implications on our society.

### What kind of content do you consume?
Text, text, text. Most of my content consumption is textual â€“ books, articles, blog posts, tweets, etc. The bulk of this content tends to be related to tech and/or its interplay with other aspects of our life. I am also a big fan of fictional visual content, specifically movies and television shows. My favourite genre is sci-fi.

### What are the sources for your consumption?
Books, newsletters, recommendation engines for articles, and Twitter.

### What type of content would you experiment with soon?
More audio content, both for fiction (audio books) and non-fiction (podcasts & clubhouse).
